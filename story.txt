Once upon a time...
There was a person with a weird gift.
The gift was a weird talent.
It was chirstmas time 
There was snow everywhere! And suddenly a huge dinosaur burst into the room.
The boy's eye grew wide in excitement! He looked towards his parents, "can I go ride on the dinosaurs back!?"
The boy's parents said no, but he insisted anyways
Then finally the boy parent let him.
Once the boy has gotten on the dinosaurs back, they pull out a chair, put on a bid and grab a spoon and ate a tub of ice cream.
As the boy got on the dinosaur's back he notice a small sparkle near the neck of the dinosaur. He started crawling towards the neck just to reach at the neck.
